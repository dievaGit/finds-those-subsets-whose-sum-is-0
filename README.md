Fundamentals of Computer Programming with C#-cap7-Exercise9
We are given 5 integer numbers. Write a program that finds those
subsets whose sum is 0. Examples:
- If we are given the numbers {3, -2, 1, 1, 8}, the sum of -2, 1 and 1
is 0.
- If we are given the numbers {3, 1, -7, 35, 22}, there are no subsets
with sum 0.
